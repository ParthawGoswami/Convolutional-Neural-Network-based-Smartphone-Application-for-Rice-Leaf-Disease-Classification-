This project presents a deep learning based smartphone application to classify three common rice leaf diseases: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot and Leaf Smut. A simple CNN has been designed for faster operation targeting the smart phone application suitability. The disease affected region is segmented using K-means clustering based segmentation approach from the resized and augmented rice leaf dataset. The model has been trained using augmented data set of 2700 images, validated with 1200 images and tested on 630 images of three common rice leaf diseases: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot and Leaf Smut. The test classification accuracy is obtained as 97.9%. The model performance has been compared to related works and found satisfactory for practical application of automated rice leaf diseases detection system.  In consequence, the trained model is exported into smart phone application to introduce real life application of the outcome of this work by capturing the infected leaf using smartphone camera.
